# Dropbox

This gem extends [Paperclip](https://github.com/thoughtbot/paperclip) with
Dropbox storage.

## Installation

Put it in your `Gemfile`:

```ruby
gem "paperclip-dropbox"
```

And run `bundle install`.

## Dropbox Setup

You must [create a Dropbox app](https://www.dropbox.com/developers/apps) and
authorize it to access the Dropbox account you want to use for storage. You have
a choice of two access levels: **App folder** or **Full Dropbox**.

### "Full Dropbox" access

Files will be stored in the [Public folder](https://www.dropbox.com/help/16/en).
Download URLs are predictable, valid forever, and don't require an API call to
retrieve, but this may not be a good thing if you don't want your files to be
easily accessed. When using one account to store data for multiple sites (e.g.
staging and production instances), it's up to you to make sure they don't step
on each other's toes.

Note that accounts created after October 4, 2012 don't have the Public folder
enabled by default: [Go here](https://www.dropbox.com/enable_public_folder) to
enable it. If you get a message that the folder is deleted, just create a folder
in the root named "Public", and it should gain the special icon.

### "App folder" access

Files will be stored in a subfolder under Apps (configurable in the app
settings). Download URLs are generated on demand by calling the Dropbox API, and
are only valid for 4 hours. This means your files are slightly "less public",
and you can isolate data from multiple sites by creating multiple apps.

**In app folder mode, every call to `#url` on an attachment will result in an
HTTP request to Dropbox.** Whether or not this is acceptable will depend on what
you're storing and how you're exposing it to users.

### Authorizing your app

After creating your app, it will have an "App key" and "App secret". Provide
these to the authorization Rake task:

```
$ rake dropbox:authorize APP_KEY=your_app_key APP_SECRET=your_app_secret
```

It will output an authorization URL that you must visit to grant the app access.
It will then output your access token, access token secret, and user ID.

For non-Rails projects, you must require this task in your `Rakefile`:

```ruby
# Rakefile
load "paperclip/dropbox/tasks.rake"
```

## Configuration

Example:

```ruby
class User < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_attached_file :avatar,
    :storage => :dropbox,
    :dropbox_credentials => "#{Rails.root}/config/dropbox.yml",
    :dropbox_options => {...}
end
```

### The `:dropbox_credentials` option

This can be a hash or path to a YAML file containing the keys listed in the
example below. These are obtained from your Dropbox app settings and the
authorization Rake task.

Example `config/dropbox.yml`:

```erb
app_key: <%= ENV["DROPBOX_APP_KEY"] %>
app_secret: <%= ENV["DROPBOX_APP_SECRET"] %>
access_token: <%= ENV["DROPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN"] %>
access_token_secret: <%= ENV["DROPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET"] %>
user_id: <%= ENV["DROPBOX_USER_ID"] %>
access_level: <%= ENV["DROPBOX_ACCESS_LEVEL"] %>
```

It is good practice to not include the credentials directly in the YAML file.
Instead you can set them in environment variables and embed them with ERB. Note
`access_level` must be either `"dropbox"` or `"app_folder"` depending on the
access level of your app; see **Dropbox Setup** above.

If not using the ENV approach, this option can also be a hash of environments:

```ruby
:dropbox_credentials => {
  :development => ...,
  :production => ...
}
```

In Rails apps, credentials will be auto-selected based on `Rails.env`. Otherwise
they can be manually selected using the `:environment` option described below.

### The `:dropbox_options` option

This is a hash containing any of the following options:

- `:path` – Block, works similarly to Paperclip's `:path` option
- `:unique_filename` – Boolean, whether to generate unique names for files in
  the absence of a custom `:path`
- `:environment` – String, the environment name to use for selecting namespaced
  credentials in a non-Rails app

The `:path` option should be a block that returns a path that the uploaded file
should be saved to. The block yields the attachment style and is executed in the
scope of the model instance. For example:

```ruby
class User < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_attached_file :avatar,
    :storage => :dropbox,
    :dropbox_credentials => "#{Rails.root}/config/dropbox.yml",
    :styles => { :medium => "300x300" },
    :dropbox_options => {
      :path => proc { |style| "#{style}/#{id}_#{avatar.original_filename}" }
    }
end
```

Let's say now that a new user is created with the ID of `23`, and a `photo.jpg`
as his avatar. The following files would be saved to the Dropbox:

```
Public/original/23_photo.jpg
Public/medium/23_photo_medium.jpg
```

The other file is called `photo_medium.jpg` because style names (other than
`original`) will always be appended to the filenames, for better management.

Filenames within a Dropbox folder must be unique; uploading a file with a
duplicate name will throw error `Paperclip::Storage::Dropbox::FileExists`. If
you don't want to bother crafting your own unique filenames with the `:path`
option, you can instead set the `:unique_filename` option to true and it will
take care of that.

### URL options

When using `dropbox` access level, the `#url` method of attachments returns a
URL to a "landing page" that provides a preview of the file and a download link.
To make `#url` return a direct file download link, set the `:download` option as
a parameter:

```ruby
user.avatar.url(:download => true)
```

When using `app_folder` access level, `#url` always returns a direct link, and
setting the `:download` option simply forces the file to be downloaded even if
the browser would normally just display it.
